# Attractors

Drawing some attractor functions. Should build on Windows (Visual Studio),
OS X and Linux (clang++, SCons). Uses a (very slightly) modified lodepng for
writing out images.

## Attractor functions?

Iterative functions that tend towards a particular set. Sometimes this is a
single value, or a cycle of a handful of values. Sometimes, it's a large
set of values that when plotted, draw a pretty pattern. This project tries
to find and draw the latter.
